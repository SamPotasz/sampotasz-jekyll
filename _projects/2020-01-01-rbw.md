## THREE PARAGRAPHS

I partnered with [FarBridge](https://farbridge.com/) on this project to design the UX for applications playing and managing 360-video content across desktop, mobile, and VR platforms. The app gives people access to therapy content through a corporate wellness program.

Through interviews with the client team and reviewing their past research, we came up with a list of epics and user stories that needed to be covered in the first prototype. I then turned these stories into wireframes in Sketch. Then we tested the wireframes as clickable prototypes using Marvel to get usability feedback.

Along with needing to display content across three devices, I also had to design an account management system for the desktop display. 

One challenging aspect of designing in VR is the novelty of the affordances for most people. Thanks to my work designing mobile apps for kids, I'm used to keeping buttons big and obvious. 

When you're working with a laser-pointer-like clicker as in VR, you can't scroll or swipe, you need big chunky buttons to navigate lists.

The VR experience is the headliner experience

The VR app is the showcase experience, there are mobile and desktop players as well, and then there's a desktop "account manager" mode as well.
